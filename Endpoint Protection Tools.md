# EPT | Endpoint Protection Tools
## What are Endpoint Protection Tools?
Endpoint security or endpoint protection tools are tools used by many companies from small businesses to large enterprises. These tools ensure that day to day operations can run flawlessly without the worry of intrusions. Endpoint devices such as servers, workstations, laptops, smartphones and many other devices are the points where cyber threats can intrude a company's network. Endpoint protection tools come equipped with firewalls, anti-virus and security software to assure unwanted attempts of access are not made on the endpoints. 
Endpoint security tools are a must as more companies are implementing BOYD (Bring your own device). This is where the tools can come in handy to make sure outside threats are not entering the network via the endpoints.
